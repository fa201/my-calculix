CONFIGURATION FILES FOR CALCULIX
================================

CGX
***
There is 2 setup for Calculix GraphiX.
Commands in ".cgx" file are executed at CGX startup. Font sizes, display of elements, ruler and initial view are setp up.
I added 3 user command displayed in the user menu. These commands are *.fbl files stored in ".cgx_user" folder.

These files are hidden files in linux (filename starting with a ".") so I replaced this by "dot_" in this repository.
Of course you have to rename these files as follows:
dot_cgx -> .cgx
dot_cgx_user -> .cgx_user
