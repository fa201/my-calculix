# My Calculix

This is related to CrunchiX (CCX) and Graphix (CGX). This is not a fork of [Calculix](http://calculix.de/), rather the place where I share some of my:
- help files
- tips
- configuration files
- examples
- documents gathered on the web related to Calculix or meshing tools

## Comparison with other codes
External documents comparing Calculix performance to other FEM codes.
[Thesis of Dilip Neupane about  static analysis](https://www.theseus.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/87106/Neupane_Dilip.pdf)

## Configuration
Configuration files for CGX start up and a few macro to set isometric views.
Check *Read_me.txt* files for information and renaming instructions.

## Contact documents
[Thesis of Jaro Hokkanen about segment-to-segment penalty contact](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/80711571.pdf).
[Thesis of Saskia Sitzmann about robust algorithms for contact](https://opus4.kobv.de/opus4-fau/files/7198/dissertation_sitzmann_saskia.pdf)

## Help
### Two HTML files help to reach CCX and CGX HTML files
- *ccx_extract.html*: link to HTML keywords for CCX documentation.
- *cgx_quick_reference.html*: link to HTML keywords for CGX documentation.
These files should be copied to the CCX or CGX HTML documentation folder.

### Two HTML files with tips gathered from forumsor documentations
- *ccx_tips.html*
- *cgx_tips.html*

## Tutorials
HTML files linking to video tutorials for:
- Finite Element Method
- CCX, CGX, Netgen, FreeCAD and GMSH. CCX remains the solver.

## CCX_examples_my_choice.ods
LibreOffice spreadsheet with my choice of CCX examples from [Calculix](http://calculix.de/), mainly mechanical (contact, frequency, linear and non-linear). No CFD, no electromagnetics and no heat.
Main features of exemples are stored to ease the search for examples based on topics.
Feel free to add missing examples and to open an issue to share you examples.
